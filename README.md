# VM-Allocation-Optimization-Using-Genetic-Algorithms
This project aims to optimize the allocation of Virtual Machines (VMs) to Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) using Genetic Algorithms (GAs). The goal is to find an optimal or near-optimal allocation strategy that balances several criteria, such as cost, reliability, and latency.
